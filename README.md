## 📑 How to Use This Repository

1. Begin from folder **[01](./01-datasets/)** and follow folder sequence in ascending order.  
2. Each experiment is documented in **`.md`** (Markdown) format.  
3. Screenshots in **[07-screenshots](./07-screenshots/)** should be referred during viva.  
4. Processed datasets are stored in **[01-datasets/processed](./01-datasets/processed)** for reproducibility.  
5. Models, rules, and clustering results are organized and named clearly.
